Pixel‑perfect Element Screenshots 🚀

Capture any HTML element exactly as rendered — all CSS, fonts, and layout preserved. Supports elements larger than the viewport. Lightweight and library-free.

Why this matters: Other tools often lose styling or fonts when capturing elements. Element Snap guarantees you get exactly what you see.

What's included:  
● Perfect quality — preserves 100% of fonts, styles, and layout  
● Full element capture — automatically stitches oversized elements  
● Live padding & margin — add custom spacing with instant preview  
● Rounded corners — standard or smooth squircle (iOS-like) rounding  
● Multiple export formats — PNG, JPG, WEBP, or SVG with quality control  
● Theme support — Light, Dark, or System with auto-detection  
● Redaction Tools — Blur, Pixelate, or cover sensitive data before sharing  
● Element hiding — temporarily hide distractions with one keypress (H)  
● Dim mode — reduce overlay opacity for better visibility  
● Fast workflow — hover to select, then Ctrl/Cmd+Click to capture

How it works:
1. Click the extension icon to activate  
2. Hover to highlight the element you want  
3. Adjust settings in the floating panel (padding, format, corners, etc.)  
4. Ctrl/Cmd+Click to capture — or use the Capture button

Customize your defaults in the extension Options page (right-click icon → Options).

Built with vanilla JavaScript and zero external libraries for maximum speed and reliability.
